# Recently Played Store

## Description
Recently Played Store is a Python script that creates an in-memory store for recently played songs that can accommodate N songs per user, with a fixed initial capacity. It allows you to store a list of song-user pairs and fetch recently played songs based on the user. When the store becomes full, it automatically eliminates the least recently played songs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to run the Recently Played Store on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

To run the script, you'll need:

Python 3.x installed on your local machine
A code editor such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text

## Installing

Clone this repository to your local machine.
```git clone https://github.com/username/recently-played-store.git ```



ruby
pod 'DoubleArrayLibrary'


## Usage
Using DoubleThisArray is simple. Import the library, create an array of Floats, and then call the doubleThisArray function to double the elements:

swift
import DoubleThisArray

let inputArray: [Float] = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
let doubledArray = doubleThisArray(inputArray)
doubledArray will now contain the doubled values of the input array: [2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0].
